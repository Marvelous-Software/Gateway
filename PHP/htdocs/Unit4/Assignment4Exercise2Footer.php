Exercise 2
----------
Create 3 files (i.e. header.php, main.php, footer.php) and use the PHP 
built-in function include() to implement an HTML page with the structure 
showed below. Notice that the main portion of the page includes the 
multiplication table that you implemented for the homework assignment 3.

<?php 

echo "<div style='background-color:#B4C7E7; border-top:1px solid darkblue;'>";
echo "    <br>";
echo "    <h4>This is the footer of the page</h4>";
echo "    <br>";
echo "    <br>";
